# DANI 

Description
------------

Develop and Nurture Interface (DANI) was originally the brainchild of Rebecca Schleimer who was inspired by her older autistic brother, Daniel. Each time she would go out to eat with him, his impatience was soothed by scrolling through Pinterest on her phone. Max Patten, Saron Nhong, Marina Delkova-Moro and Rebecca collaborated to create an app to provide kids with autism a source of entertainment and learning. The goal of the app is to improve the lives of children with autism as well as their families. 

The app itself is divided into three units: Look, Listen, Learn. Each of these units contains three modules for engagement and or learning. For example, within the Look unit the user will find an Images module which contains images of various categories from different subreddits, as well as a module containing several educational childrens videos and a 360 degree images module. Other modules on the app include ones for drawing, coloring, spelling, among others.
